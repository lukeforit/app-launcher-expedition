# Expedition 33 Launcher

This is a fun project (work in progress) to create an Android app launcher inspired (clearly) by Expedition 33.

## How it works

## Features

*   **App Launcher:** Functions as a home screen replacement to the system launcher.
*   **Navigation 3:** Uses the latest Navigation 3 library for screen transitions including bottom sheet `ScreenStrategy`
*   **Adaptive Icons:** Displays adaptive icons for all apps.

### Further improvements

* Cleanup the project (from hardcoded values to lose hanging functions)
* Better separation of concerns
* More features!

For those who come after! :nerd_face:
